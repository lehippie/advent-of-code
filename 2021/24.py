    The input is divided in 14 blocks, each doing almost the same calculations.
    Shared instructions are:
    - w is only used to store the input digit
    - x is always initialized to z % 26
    - y is always initialized to 25

    =>  Thus, we can skip some instructions to speed the search and
        z is the only value to keep from one block to the next.

    It's still a slow brute-force answer with minimum analysis but at least
    each part runs in less around 15 minutes.
